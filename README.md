# My angular 2+ study and playground

Set out to learn angular 4 based only on docs and latest written tutorials.  
Video tutorials tend to have outdated parts.  

The functionaliy was created following lessons from:  
* https://angular.io/guide/component-interaction  
* http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2016/12/01/angular-2-communicating-between-components-with-observable-subject  

Some functionality and file names are slightly altered, to explore what I can modify without braking the code.
